## About This Project

Point of Sales (POS) is a system used to process sales transactions between sellers and buyers. This system records sales, calculates total prices, taxes, discounts, and change, and can print receipts.

-   Modern POS systems are usually equipped with additional features such as:
-   Stock management
-   Sales report
-   User management (cashier, admin, manager)
-   Integration with receipt printers and payment systems

This POS system was created to simplify the transaction process and sales management, especially in the Central Jakarta PPKD operational environment.
